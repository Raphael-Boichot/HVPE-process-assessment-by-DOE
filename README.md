## Epitaxial Growth of AlN on (0001) Sapphire: Assessment of HVPE Process by a Design of Experiments Approach

**Supporting data for paper https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings7090136**

This repo contains all the raw data, Matlab codes and methods we used to carry an assessment of the HVPE process (Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy) by a DOE (Design of experiment) method. In this study, we've tried to understand what were the leading parameters explaining the crystal quality of Aluminum nitride grown on sapphire (numerous applications in microelectronics like UV leds, THz band pass filters, etc.). We used a classical screening method assisted with Hadamard matrices. The conclusion of the study was that many features of the grown layer can be linked to growth parameters with good statistical confidence, except the crystal "quality" expressed a the FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum) of the 0002 diffraction peak in XRD Ï‰-scan (roughly proportionnal to the dislocation density). We think now that this quality is essentially linked to the temperature stability of the seed layer (the sapphire) just prior the first seconds of growth, parameter not included in this study at that time.
